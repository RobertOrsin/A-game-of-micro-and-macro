\chapter{Intro}

A Game of Micro and Macro is a two-player board-game consisting of two parts.

A tabletop-style skirmish game, in which units battle against each other and a card-laying game in which both players build a base to support their units on the battlefields.

The rules and materials necessary to play this game are described in this book.

\chapter{General Rules}

\section{Preparation}
Before the game starts some preparations have to be made for both parts of the game.

The first action is to check who gets priority. For that matter both players roll a D6. The player with the highest value gets the first priority. Re-roll on a tie.

\subsection{Micro}
The battlefield is build up. Each player picks an even amount of terrain-pieces. Both players place their pieces alternating on the board.

The miniatures (models/units) used during the game a placed next to the board.

Both players teach each other about their units. This does not have to include possible modifications to the units made during the macro-game.

Both players place a marker on the board representing the entry-point of the macro-game.

\subsection{Macro}
Both players shuffle their decks and place them face down to the side. Building-cards a placed in the bottom. Right in front of them is their main building card. Each player draws five cards from their deck.

To keep track of game stats like the amount of available resources and life-points a fair amount of spin-down-dice or pen and paper are in reach.

\begin{figure}[t]

\caption{Overview of a fresh game}
\end{figure}

\section{A turn}
A turn is structured as follows.

\begin{enumerate}
\item the player with priority draws one cards
\item triggered abilities of buildings and upgrades are played
\item the player with priority takes three actions from the following list
\begin{enumerate}
\item command a unit in the micro-game
\item build a unit from a building or upgrade
\item use a card-ability
\item play a card from his hand
\item pass the turn
\end{enumerate}
\end{enumerate}

After each action, the other player has the opportunity to react. As a reaction cards with the attribute \emph{instant} can be played.\\
\\
After each action, or reaction it is checked if the game is finished.\\
\\
If all actions are made, priority changes and the next turn starts.

\section{End of Game}
A game is finished if the main-building of a player is destroyed. This player has lost the game.\\
\\
A game is also finished if a player is not able to perform an action other then passing the turn. This player has lost the game.\\
\\
Other then that, a player is allowed to concede at any time.


\section{Out of Cards}
If a player is out of cards to draw from his deck his main-building is dealt one damage. This is done for each card.
If a player needs to draw two cards, the main building is dealt two damage.\\


\section{Base-range}
Base-range describes the radius of a base starting from the center of the base-marker. The radius changes with the number of building inside the base.
The range of the base is always checked if the number of buildings change or another action needs to know the current radius.

The range of the base is set as follows

\begin{center}
 \begin{tabular}{||c c||} 
 \hline
 No. of Buildings & Radius\\
 \hline\hline
 1 & 1 \\ 
 \hline
 2 & 1.5 \\
 \hline
 3 & 2 \\
 \hline
 4 & 2.5\\
 \hline
 5 & .. \\
 \hline
\end{tabular}
\end{center}

The base range is needed for attack made by units against the base.


\chapter{Micro}

Micro is a skirmish miniature game. Each player has a set of miniature which can come into play.

Each Miniature, or type of miniature has a fixed set of attributes and skills which makes them unique.

\section{Attributes}
Each attribute, except for movement and life-points, is represented by a dice. The amount of surfaces indicates how powerful the attribute is.
That does not mean that you need a die for each attribute of each model. One set of dice will do.

Surface count goes from 4 (D4) - weak, to 20 (D20) - strong. In between are D6, 8, 10, 12 and 16.

If something causes an attribute to increase by an amount, it means ti increase the die used. For example if a unit has an attack of D4. an increase by two ups it to D8.\\
\\
Movement and life-points are plain values between 1 and 100

\begin{description}
\item[Life-points (LP)]
Amount of damage necessary to kill a unit
\item[Movement (M)]
maximum amount a unit can move in centimeters
\item[Attack (A)]
Strength of a physical attack
\item[Spell-power (SP)]
Strength of a magical attack
\item[Defense (D)]
Ability to withstand a physical attack
\item[Magic Defense (MD)]
Ability to withstand a magical attack
\end{description}

\section{Roll-Off}
In a Roll-Off both players roll a die. The attacker wins if is value is greater the the value of the defender.

If a die rolls its highest possible score, the player can add seven to the value. This counts as a critical hit and enables smaller units to hit a big blow against bigger foes.

\section{Allocating Damage}
To deal damage from one unit to another the corresponding attributes of attacker and defender clash in a roll off.

For physical damage (A) and (D) are taken to a roll off. For a magic attack (SP) and (MD).

If the attack is physical or magic is the choice of the attacker, but is determined by some factors like range, visibility and the kind of items a unit has.\\
\\
For example, if a unit is equipped with a rusty sword and knows the leech seed spell its options is to do a melee-attack with its rusty sword, if a unit is nearby, or hurl its leech seed onto a target which is within the range of the spell and can be seen by the unit.\\
To see a unit, virtually draw a line between the attacker and target. This line should not be interrupted by any kind of terrain.

\section{Micro-Actions}
If a player decides to command a unit as one of his two game-actions he has the following options.

\begin{enumerate}
\item Pick a unit or unit-group
\item Pick a unit-action and use it
\item Pick another, or the same unit-action and use it
\end{enumerate}

\subsection{Unit-Group}
Units of the same kind ,or bound through other rules, with a maximum distance of two to each other can be commanded as a group.

\subsection{Unit-Action}
Units have the following actions.

\begin{enumerate}
\item Moving
\item Physical Attack
\item Magical Attack
\item Entrench/Mobilize
\end{enumerate}

\subsubsection{Moving}
The unit or group moves its maximum movement-value, or less.
In a group, each unit uses its own movement-value. Single units of a group may loose the connection to the group. These units do not participate in other actions done by the group.

\subsubsection{Physical Attack}
To make a physical attack a unit, or group, uses its equipped weapon, or weapon set. 
A unit can only carry one weapon, or weapon set.
What weapon or weapon set is carried is determined by the building which produced the unit. The wielded weapon can be changed with upgrade-cards in the macro-game.
All units start with a weapon or basic attack-effect.\\
\\
Each weapon has a range in which the target has to be. Melee-weapons, e.g. Swords, have a range of one.\\
\\
Weapons can have extra effects. These can be triggered on a attack or permanent effects on the carrier and its stats.\\
%\\
%All weapons can be carried by all units, if no effekt says otherwise.\\
%\\
%If a Unit dies a attacker in meele-range can pick up the defenders weapon and use it.

\subsubsection{Magical Attack}
To make a magical attack a unit needs to be able to cast a spell. Spells are learned through playing upgrade-cards on buildings in the macro-game.\\
\\
Spells, like weapons, have a maximum range in which the target has to be.\\
\\
All spells have an effect triggered after a successful roll off. Some spells may have effects triggered by a lost roll off.\\
\\
There are some general spells usable by all units. Most of them are special to a small number of units. Those spells are accordingly marked on their upgrade-card. Either with the name of the unit or with the symbol of the faction/race which can use the spell.\\
\\
A Spell targeting a friendly unit does not need a roll off\\
\\
Within a group, only one unit can cast a spell.

\subsubsection{Entrench/Mobilize}
A unit, or group, can entrench themselves, or mobilize if it is already entrenched.
Entrenched units, or groups, can make an attack if an enemy unit, or group, get in its attack-range.
The attack is made immediately, before any other attacks or actions.\\
After the attack, the unit, or group, is mobilized.\\
\\
Entrenched units can note make normal moves, they first have to mobilize.

\chapter{Macro}
Macro is a card-laying game in which each players builds a base. The base is then used to build and upgrade units which are send out in the micro-game to destroy the enemy base.

For that matter, each player has a custom deck of cards. A deck is made up of cards of different types.

All cards have a faction- or race-symbol. A deck can only contain cards of the same symbol. Unless a rule says otherwise.

\section{Card-types}
Card-types determine where and who a card is played. The following card-types exist.

\begin{enumerate}
\item Buildings
\item Upgrades
\item Instants
\end{enumerate}

\subsection{Buildings}
Buildings are faction-dependent and marked with the factions symbol. Each Building as a number of life-points and a defense-attribute.
Units can deal damage to buildings and reduce the points. If a building has no life-points left it is destroyed.\\
\\
A Building usually has a rule-text which includes active abilities or triggered card-effects.\\
\\
A Building has upgrade-slots, up to a maximum of three.
Upgrade-cards can be played onto building. Some upgrades require to be played on special buildings or have other conditions.

\begin{figure}[t]
\includegraphics[scale=1.0]{examplebuilding}
\centering
\caption{Anatomy of a building}
\end{figure}

\subsubsection{Build buildings}
To build a building a building-card is selected from the pile of building-cards next to the playing-field. Its resource-costs need to be paid as it enters the battlefield.
New buildings a place to the left side of the last placed building.

\subsubsection{Dealing damage to buildings}
Damage to buildings is dealt by units from the micro-game. The same rules to a roll-off apply. If a unit is in range to the base-marker of an enemy-base it attacks the most left building.\\
\\
To deal damage to the base, or buildings, a unit needs to be in attack-range. This includes the range of its own weapon and the radius the base has, determined by the number of buildings in it.

\subsection{Upgrades}
Upgrades are cards played onto buildings. Upgrades modify units and/or the buildings they are played on. Some upgrade can only be played on certain building or have other conditions.

If an upgrade-slot is already used, it can be overwritten with a new upgrade.The upgrade which is overwritten has no effect, unless another rule says otherwise.\\

\begin{figure}[t]
\includegraphics[scale=1.0]{examplecard}
\centering
\caption{Anatomy of a main-deck-card}
\end{figure}

\subsection{Instants}
Instants a one-time effects with an effect which is handheld directly after it is played. Instants can be played in a players turn and in the enemies turn as a reaction to an action.\\

\newpage
\section{Card-effects and -abilities}
Card-effects, unless they are triggered from another event, can be activated by a player as one of their actions. A card-effect can only be activated once per turn, unless a rules says otherwise.\\
\\
Triggered abilities are resolved immediately they are triggered.\\
\\
Active card-effects may have a cost which has to be payed before the effect is resolved.

\chapter{Factions and Races}
Each player has chosen a faction with which he plays a game. The chosen faction is represented by the players deck of cards, buildings and units. Each of these are kind of unique to each faction and represent a different play-style.

In this chapter, the characteristics and units of each faction is described.
\newpage

\chapter{Whispers from the Realm}

In this chapter, some stories from around the world in which this game is set in are told.

\section{River rivalry}

Far south of the kingdoms of men is a river, called gayas vain. It is used to transport goods inside the kingdoms for millennia.\\
And since then who ever controls the river is the richest and mightiest in this region.\\
\\
On each side of the river are the kingdoms of Anhakir (1) to the left and Bethrakir (2) to the right.These kingdoms are arch rivals and fight constantly for control over the river and the massive amount of gold it generates with each ship passing in and out of it.\\
The high-king fears that this conflict could destabilize the kingdom of men as a hole and looks with despite at it.\\
Anhakir and Bethrakir are small in size and surrounded by other enemies as well.\\
Anhakir is flanked by the swamps (4) which are lived by the swampbeasts and bloodmages, while Bethrakir is threaded from the mountain-men (4) who reach out from the mountains to the east.\\
\\
Only the power of gold, generated by the river and its trespassers keep these kingdoms alive and their enemies at bay. In a constant back and forth both realms are able to sustain. But the long, centuries spanning, rivalry make it impossible for both kingdoms to fuse together.

\newpage
\section{Bloodmage-duel}

Bloodmages, while being one of the bigger threads to everything inhabiting the swamps, are also feuding against each other. The supply of fresh, quality blood from the different sources needed to advance ones power is scarce.\\
\\
The lands of the swamps are loosely divided between the nummerous bloodmages. Borders slightly change depening on natural movements by its inhabitants.\\

\section{Highking-cabal}

It is told between clerics that the kingdoms of men will stumble in a dark chaos which, in the end, will end it. This end will come, when the 200th Highking dies.

In some churches and communities clerics and priests have the opinion that the death of the 200th Highking is a good thing and will ascend menking closer to the gods.
The aim of this small group is it to crown and kill Highkings to finish the count at 200.

In the shadows of chapels, churches and monasteries clerics of different belief are at war.
